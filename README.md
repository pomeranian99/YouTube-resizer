# YouTube Resizer
A simple web tool where you enter the URL for a YouTube video and it displays it at the full size of your browser's current window.

The rationale: I wanted to expand a video to a custom size -- often a coding video -- while flipping back and forth from my IDE.

YouTube's "Theater Mode" is pretty good, but I wanted to strip out everything except for the video.

This is a super useless tool to pretty much everyone but me, I would suspect.
