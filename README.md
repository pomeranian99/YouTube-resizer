# YouTube Resizer

A simple web tool where you enter the URL for a YouTube video and it displays it at the full size of your browser's current window. To enter a new video URL, refresh the page.

The rationale? I'd often be watching a video -- a coding video, something for research -- and wanted to expand it to a custom size for maximum legibility, without going into "full screen" mode.

YouTube's "Theater Mode" is pretty good, but I wanted to strip out everything except for the video.

Hence, this thing!

A super useless tool to pretty much everyone but me, I would suspect, but what the hell.
